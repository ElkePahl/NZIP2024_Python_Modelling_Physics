#  Modelling Physics in Python
## NZIP 2024: 3-Weeks Professional Development Module

In completing the module, you will gain the knowledge to create Python notebooks, enabling you to construct interactive  coding worksheets for use in your classroom.

- Tailored for teachers with *no/minimal experience in programming* and who wish to enhance their teaching toolkit by acquiring a new skill.
- Experience with teaching *Level2 Kinematics* is required.
- Dates for 3 online sessions: **Tuesday 7th May, 14th May and 28th May at 7:30pm**

The notebooks can be opened in google colab - if you do not have an account yet, please make one using a gmail address.
Clicking the ```google colab``` buttons below will directly open the corresponding notebooks in google colab.
In order to open the link in a new tab on your browser, just do CTRL+click (on Windows and Linux) or CMD+click (on MacOS).

Changes to your notebooks can easily be saved from google colab on your computer or your google drive. We will cover this in the first session.
